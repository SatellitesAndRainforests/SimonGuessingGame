(i pasted this into codepen after codeing it in vim and chrome. i dont think it likes some of the code i used for the animation, also i diddnt really like the strict mode so i just left it at the top to show i did it. i can see where this could be more polished but i feel ive learnt enough from doing it and want to move on, im quite pleased but could spend a lot longer making it better, but i dont think it would be a good use of time</p>
